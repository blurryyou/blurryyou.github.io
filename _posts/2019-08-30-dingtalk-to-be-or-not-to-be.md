My company used a self-developed OA software. 

It's quite lovely. 

Supports calendar, inner text message, mailbox, signup, etc. 

Even an inner social network, similar to the WeChat Moments.

But we switched to DingTalk early this year.

It was hard, I suppose, to maintain a quite complex OA system independently. 

Especially when we are still a quite small business, with three to four hundred staff. 

DingTalk was almost born to be evil, in some critics' eyes. 

For it's an Alibaba APP.

I tried DingTalk a few years ago, when it was still a start-up project. 

It impressed me that, it can enforce almost anyone in the organization to respond to you, without too much trouble. 

It can be evil, as it enables the leaders without any sense of the boundaries between the work hours and personal hours. 

On the other hand, I'm a believer in the innocence of the technologies. 

As I mentioned above, my company switched to DingTalk about half a year ago. 

Luckily, my boss never forced any of us to respond ASAP using DingTalk. 

(He, indeed, would `mention` me, or `direct message` others on GitHub issue, on Slack, or on any communication channels as he sees fit around the clock. Without expecting the response before the office hour starts. But that's another story.)

Still, my point is proved. 

Today, DingTalk reaches 200 million users. 

Congratulations. 

And let's make a wish: More my bosses and less the devil's pawns.
